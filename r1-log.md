The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 15, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D0
Wrote my first blog post ever (https://medium.com/@dan.pecher/a-new-start-advancing-in-programming-by-building-projects-ad1908070009) to set myself clear on my goals and tell others what I plan on doing.

### R1D1
Started work on first app, and trying to keep it simple from the beginning - it's a note-taking app: https://github.com/danpecher/notes-app. Setup a rails project and create empty components.

### R1D2
Setup css modules and created basic layout with switchable notes (only dummy data for now). I haven't added redux to the project, but probably will. I feel like redux (or some other state management) is useful even in tiniest apps.

### R1D3
Replaced dummy notes with actual data from db and added some buttons (add, save, delete). Adding works, next step is to make saving and deleting work.
