## Log

### R1D0
Wrote my first blog post ever (https://medium.com/@dan.pecher/a-new-start-advancing-in-programming-by-building-projects-ad1908070009) to set myself clear on my goals and tell others what I plan on doing.

### R1D1
Started work on first app, and trying to keep it simple from the beginning - it's a note-taking app: https://github.com/danpecher/notes-app. Setup a rails project and create empty components.
